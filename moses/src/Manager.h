/** The Manager class implements a stack decoding algorithm.
 * Hypotheses are organized in stacks. One stack contains all hypothesis that have 
 * the same number of foreign words translated.  The data structure for hypothesis 
 * stacks is the class HypothesisCollection. The data structure for a hypothesis 
 * is the class Hypothesis. 
 *
 * The main decoder loop in the function ProcessSentence() consists of the steps: 
 * - Create the list of possible translation options. In phrase-based decoding 
 *   (and also the first mapping step in the factored model) is a phrase translation 
 *   from the source to the target. Given a specific input sentence, only a limited 
 *   number of phrase translation can be applied. For efficient lookup of the 
 *   translation options later, these optuions are first collected in the function 
 *   CreateTranslationOption (for more information check the class 
 *   TranslationOptionCollection) 
 * - Create initial hypothesis: Hypothesis stack 0 contains only one empty hypothesis. 
 * - Going through stacks 0 ... (sentence_length-1): 
 *   - The stack is pruned to the maximum size 
 *   - Going through all hypotheses in the stack 
 *     - Each hypothesis is expanded by ProcessOneHypothesis() 
 *     - Expansion means applying a translation option to the hypothesis to create 
 *       new hypotheses 
 *     - What translation options may be applied depends on reordering limits and 
 *       overlap with already translated words 
 *     - With a applicable translation option and a hypothesis at hand, a new 
 *       hypothesis can be created in ExpandHypothesis() 
 *     - New hypothesis are either discarded (because they are too bad), added to 
 *       the appropriate stack, or re-combined with existing hypotheses
